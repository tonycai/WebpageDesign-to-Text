# Acceptance Criteria for WebpageDesign-to-Text

These acceptance criteria define the specific conditions that must be met for each user story to be considered successfully implemented. They follow the Given-When-Then format.

## As a UX Researcher

### Story: Automatically get a textual description of the webpage's UI and layout.
* **Given** a valid URL is provided as input,
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** a textual description of the webpage's UI elements and their layout is generated and presented to the user.

### Story: Textual description includes UI element types, location/grouping, and text content.
* **Given** a webpage with various UI elements (e.g., buttons, text fields, navigation menus, images with alt text),
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** the textual description includes the identified types of these UI elements.
* **And** the description provides information about their approximate relative location or grouping on the page.
* **And** the text content of text-based elements and the alt text of images (if available via OCR) are included in the description.

### Story: Infer and describe basic design styles.
* **Given** a webpage with a discernible color palette,
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** the textual description includes a mention of the prominent colors observed.
* **Given** a webpage with a consistent layout pattern (e.g., grid layout for product listings, single-column article),
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** the textual description identifies and mentions the general layout pattern.

### Story: Provide generated text to an LLM for UX feedback.
* **Given** a URL is processed and a textual description is generated,
    **When** the user copies and pastes this description into an LLM with a UX-related prompt,
    **Then** the LLM can understand the described UI structure and provide relevant feedback or suggestions based on the description.

### Story: Save the generated textual description.
* **Given** a URL is processed and a textual description is generated,
    **When** the user initiates a "save" action,
    **Then** the system saves the textual description to a local file (e.g., .txt or .md format).

## As a Web Developer

### Story: Get a textual representation of the webpage's UI structure.
* **Given** a valid URL of a webpage with a defined UI structure,
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** a textual representation highlighting the key UI components and their hierarchical or spatial relationships is generated.

### Story: Highlight key components and their relationships.
* **Given** a webpage with a header, main content area, and footer,
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** the textual representation clearly identifies these key components and their top-level relationship.
* **And** if there are nested components (e.g., navigation within the header), their relationships are also described.

### Story: Use textual description for code generation/refactoring with LLMs.
* **Given** a textual description of a UI element or section is generated,
    **When** this description is provided to an LLM with a code generation or refactoring prompt,
    **Then** the LLM can understand the described UI and generate or modify relevant code snippets.

### Story: Compare textual descriptions of different webpage versions.
* **Given** two different URLs (or two processed outputs from the same URL at different times),
    **When** the user compares the generated textual descriptions,
    **Then** the differences in UI elements and layout between the two versions are evident from the textual representations.

## As an Accessibility Auditor

### Story: Get textual description of UI elements and text content for accessibility review.
* **Given** a valid URL is provided,
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** the textual description includes identified interactive elements (e.g., buttons, links, form fields) and their associated text content (including labels where discernible via OCR).

### Story: Highlight interactive elements and their text.
* **Given** a webpage with interactive elements like buttons and links,
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** the textual description explicitly identifies these elements as interactive and includes their text labels.

### Story: Use textual output with LLMs for initial accessibility questions.
* **Given** a textual description of a webpage's UI is generated,
    **When** this description is provided to an LLM with an accessibility-focused prompt (e.g., "Based on this layout, are there likely clear visual focus indicators?"),
    **Then** the LLM can generate relevant initial questions or checks based on the described UI.

## As an AI/LLM Application Developer

### Story: Convert webpage UI to structured text for LLM training.
* **Given** a valid URL is provided,
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** a structured textual format representing the webpage UI is generated that is suitable for input into an LLM.

### Story: Textual representation captures essential visual and structural information.
* **Given** a webpage with a complex layout and various UI elements,
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** the generated textual representation captures the key visual elements, their spatial relationships, and the overall structure of the UI.

### Story: System is scriptable and integrable into AI/LLM pipelines.
* **Given** the project provides an API or command-line interface,
    **When** an AI/LLM application developer uses this interface,
    **Then** they can programmatically access the webpage processing and text generation functionalities.

## General User

### Story: Get a simplified textual summary of layout and key interactive elements.
* **Given** a valid URL is provided,
    **When** the system processes the URL,
    **Then** a concise textual summary of the main layout sections and key interactive elements (e.g., main navigation, primary buttons) is provided.

These acceptance criteria provide a more concrete understanding of what each user story aims to achieve and can be used for testing and validation during the development process. Remember to refine and expand these as your project evolves.
