# User Stories for WebpageDesign-to-Text

## As a UX Researcher

* **As a UX Researcher,** I want to input a URL so that I can automatically get a textual description of the webpage's UI elements and layout, allowing me to quickly understand the structure and identify potential usability issues without manually inspecting the page.

* **As a UX Researcher,** I want the textual description to include information about the types of UI elements (e.g., buttons, text fields, navigation), their approximate location and grouping, and any text content within them, so that I can analyze the information architecture and content hierarchy.

* **As a UX Researcher,** I want the system to infer and describe basic design styles (e.g., color palette mentions, general layout patterns like grid or single-column), so that I can assess the visual consistency and adherence to design principles.

* **As a UX Researcher,** I want to provide the generated textual description to an LLM with specific prompts related to UX best practices, so that I can get automated feedback and suggestions for improvement.

* **As a UX Researcher,** I want to be able to save the generated textual description for comparison across different versions of a webpage or competitor websites.

## As a Web Developer

* **As a Web Developer,** I want to input a URL so that I can get a textual representation of the webpage's UI structure, helping me quickly understand the layout of unfamiliar codebases or legacy systems.

* **As a Web Developer,** I want the textual output to highlight the key components and their relationships, so that I can easily navigate and modify the underlying code.

* **As a Web Developer,** I want to use the textual description as input for code generation tools or LLMs to assist in refactoring or creating similar UI components.

* **As a Web Developer,** I want to compare the textual descriptions of different versions of a webpage to quickly identify UI changes and their structural impact.

## As an Accessibility Auditor

* **As an Accessibility Auditor,** I want to input a URL and receive a textual description of the UI elements and their text content, so that I can identify potential areas for accessibility review (e.g., missing labels, unclear element hierarchy - though I understand this is not a full accessibility audit).

* **As an Accessibility Auditor,** I want the textual description to highlight the presence and text of interactive elements, so that I can prioritize areas for screen reader testing.

* **As an Accessibility Auditor,** I want to use the textual output with LLMs to generate initial questions or checks related to WCAG guidelines based on the described UI structure.

## As an AI/LLM Application Developer

* **As an AI/LLM Application Developer,** I want a reliable way to convert webpage UI into a structured textual format, so that I can use this data to train or fine-tune LLMs for UI-related tasks (e.g., UI generation, UI navigation agents).

* **As an AI/LLM Application Developer,** I want the textual representation to be detailed enough to capture the essential visual and structural information of the UI.

* **As an AI/LLM Application Developer,** I want the system to be scriptable and easily integrated into my AI/LLM pipelines.

## General User

* **As a General User with visual impairment (in a specific scenario),** I might want to input a URL and get a simplified textual summary of the webpage's layout and key interactive elements, to get a basic understanding of the page before using a screen reader. (Note: This is a simplified use case and not a replacement for proper accessibility tools).

These user stories cover a range of potential users and their needs. You can expand on these with more specific details and acceptance criteria as your project evolves. Let me know if you'd like me to refine or add more user stories!
